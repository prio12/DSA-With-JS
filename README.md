# DSA-With-JS

My journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms using **JavaScript** — includes notes, examples, and problem-solving practice.

## 📚 About this repo
This repo is where I practice and track my DSA learning.  
I solve problems, write short explanations, and note down time & space complexities.  
The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.
